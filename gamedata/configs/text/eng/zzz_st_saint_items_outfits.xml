		<text>A high quality intermediate protective bodysuit, with an enhanced design adopted by Duty faction mechanics. The armor is more protective than Duty's regular PS5 universal protection suit, yet less expensive and easier to produce than the PSZ-9d body armor variant. Made from durable composite materials and reinforced with lightweight ballistic fibers, it provides excellent protection for combat encounters. Its ease of maintenance and repair makes it ideal for Duty operatives working far from friendly territory, such as investigators venturing into the northern reaches of the Zone.

		<text>A high-end protective suit, adopted by Duty faction mechanics. Made from advanced Kevlar and reinforced with thick ceramic plates, it offers substantial protection against ballistic threats and environmental hazards. The armor is said to have been favored by the late Duty Lieutenant Colonel Shulga. Though Shulga rarely left his operational base in Yanov, he feared assassination and thus preferred heavy protection. He was later presumed dead after leading a mass assault into the city of Pripyat. Veteran Duty operatives occasionally wear models like the PSZ-9kl to honor his legacy.

		<text>A heavy ballistic vest containing Class IV plates, reinforced with steel with many of the attachment points needed for a rigid exoskeleton. However, with no powered exoskeleton to ease the load, this armor is cumbersome to wear for extended periods of time. The base exosuit is also known as the "Radsuit". The PSZ-10d Venator variant was developed on the preceding PSZ-10d design by Duty mechanics. The suit provides high ballistic and strike protection but its raw bulk is not balanced against its capabilities without additional weight support.
