# STALKER Text Overhaul

A mod for STALKER Anomaly (Monolith/Open X-Ray) to replace countless item descriptions and user interface texts. Spiritual continuation of the GAMMA Massive Text Overhaul (https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/na243662). Intended to be used in conjunction with Saint's Text Patcher, a script-based text patching mod.

## Features

Introduce new highly detailed, lore-friendly descriptions for a wide assortment of existing items. New texts were written for tools, repair items, devices (artefact detectors, dosimeter, radio equipment), miscellaneous items (trash items), as well as some food and drink items. It also includes a rewrite of the faction introduction texts displayed in the New Game screen with information gathered from STALKER wikis and years of in-game experience.

This mod directly replaces description texts for items. The localized string files load last in the engine's load order and only overwrite the records for individual descriptions. The mod is compatible with any other mod but will overwrite existing descriptions.

## License

This mod was created by Saint for free use by the STALKER modding community with basic attribution under the MIT license. It may be distributed with mod packs.
